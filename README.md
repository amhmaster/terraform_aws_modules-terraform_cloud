# Mini-project 06 (Terraform Cloud and AWS)

Created by: Than Htike Soe

ðŸ’¡ In this scenerio, I used the Terraform module to establish the VPC, abd to create the EC2 instance and Aurora RDS. In addition, I use bash scripts to install Laravel and Ngnix. And I use a security group to grant access to RDS from a single EC2 server. I assigned elastic IP to the EC2 instance so that anyone may reach it from the public.
